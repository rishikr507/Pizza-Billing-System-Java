# 🍕 Pizza Billing System (Java Console App)

A simple console-based Java application that allows users to order pizzas, enter quantities, and generate a final bill. This project demonstrates basic object-oriented design, array handling, and user interaction via the command line.

## 💡 Features
- 📋 Menu-driven console interface  
- 🍕 Supports 4 pizza types: Margherita, Farmhouse, Paneer, and Veggie Delight  
- ➕ Allows multiple item orders with custom quantities  
- 🧾 Calculates total items and grand total  
- 🧠 Designed using Java classes and methods  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 14+)  
- Scanner for input  
- switch-case control  
- Arrays for order tracking  
- OOP principles (`Item` class)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Compile: `javac PizzaBillingSystem.java`  
2. Run: `java PizzaBillingSystem`  
3. Choose options from the menu (1–4 for pizza, 5 to generate bill)

## 🍽️ Sample Menu
1. Margherita Pizza - ₹250  
2. Farmhouse Pizza  - ₹350  
3. Paneer Pizza     - ₹300  
4. Veggie Delight   - ₹280  
5. Generate Bill

## ✅ Future Improvements
- Prevent overwriting items when reordering  
- Export bill to a file  
- Add more pizzas, toppings, and discount system  
- GUI with Swing or JavaFX
